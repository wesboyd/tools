# Tools Repository

A collection of single-page HTML personal web tools.

## Design Principles

Following patterns from Simon Willison's "Things I've Learned Building HTML Tools":

### Single-File Architecture
- Each tool is ONE self-contained HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
- No build steps, no npm, no React or frameworks requiring compilation
- Keep code compact (few hundred lines) so it's easy to read, understand, and modify
- Load external libraries from CDNs (cdnjs, jsDelivr) when needed

### State Management
- Use URL hash fragments for shareable/bookmarkable state
- Use localStorage for API keys and larger persistent state
- Avoid server-side dependencies

### Input/Output Patterns
- Embrace copy-paste workflows: accept pasted content, transform it, enable clipboard copy
- Use `<input type="file">` for local file access
- Generate downloadable files client-side when needed
- Leverage rich clipboard handling (text, HTML, images, files)

### API Integration
- Prefer CORS-enabled APIs (GitHub raw content, PyPI, iNaturalist, Bluesky, Mastodon)
- Store API keys in localStorage, not in code
- Call LLM APIs directly from browser when appropriate

### Mobile/PWA Support
- Include viewport meta tags for mobile usability
- Add apple-mobile-web-app meta tags for iOS home screen support
- Consider touch interactions and responsive design

### Advanced Capabilities (when needed)
- Pyodide for running Python in browser via WebAssembly
- Existing WASM libraries (Tesseract.js for OCR, etc.)

## Development Workflow

1. Prototype with LLM artifacts (Claude, ChatGPT Canvas)
2. Iterate with coding agents for complex features
3. Reference existing tools in the repo as examples when building new ones
4. Host via GitHub Pages for permanent, reliable distribution

## File Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase names: `tool-name.html`

## Existing Tools

- `habit.html` - HabitFlow: Pomodoro-style focus timer with movement break reminders
